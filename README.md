# ARM dojo

This repository is the community maintained ARM dojo on [pwn.college](https://www.pwn.college).

The goal of this dojo is to allow learners to get familiar with the AARCH64 architecture and exploitation scenarios.  Currently, the dojo has one module titled "intro to ARM".

## Joining
The dojo is not immediately accessible on the site, but can be joined via this [invite link](https://pwn.college/dojo/robwaz-dojo~5d42f3e9/join/).

## Contributing

PRs are welcome!  Exploring AARCH64 is a personal interest, and I welcome feedback or suggestions to improve the content for everyone.
